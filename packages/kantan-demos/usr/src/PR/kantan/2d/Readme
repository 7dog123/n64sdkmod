-- How to create a ROM file

Move to the directory 2d and execute make.  

% cd 2d
% make

-- Explanation

*  It renders 64 x 64 color indexed texture (16 colors used) in the center of the screen.
*  This sample was created in the following environment:  Indy, Irix 5.3, and ultra64 Dev. Env. 2.0h,  and its operation was verified.  
* Settings of RSP and RDP are maintained minimum.   
* For "pack", a thread is not created for controlling graphics task, so it does not correspond to sound.
         It may be very difficult to use it continuously for a project.  
* The performance of the memory manager used for "pack" will become worse if a memory block increases.  Therefore, for those who use it fully, please create it on your own or use it with a high
       efficiency module.  

-- Remarks

* As also mentioned in the manual,  it has been tested using data which can fit in the texture buffer.  So it may not be practical enough to be used for the actual program. 
* In this sample program,  RDP cycle mode is used as a COPY mode, however,  please try it out using 1 cycle mode.  And in that case,  do not forget to set RenderMode and  ColorCombiner, and to change dsdx of  TextureRectangle from 4 to 1.   
* Using 1 cycle mode,  the enlarged display of the texture is available.  Please try changing parameters of TextureRectangle in many ways. 
* With 1 cycle mode, a texture filter functions.   Be sure to make TextureFilter to BILERP and render it enlarged.   Also,  try various texture patterns and know the habit of a texture engine.
* N64 has a pixel operation mode of sub pixel units. (Blender setting)  If this is used,  scrolling of less than 1 pixel can be done very beautifully.  Be sure to try it.
* Also,  N64 has an ( channel.  By surrounding the outer edge of the texture with a pixel which ( value is 0,  and changing the display location by the ST value of the texture, it is possible to render a pixel which is less than sub pixel.  Be sure to try it.
