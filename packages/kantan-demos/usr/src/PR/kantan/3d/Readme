-- How to create a ROM file

Move to the directory 3d and execute make.

% cd 3d
% make

--Explanation

* NINTENDO 64 logo mark is displayed using 3D and rotated. 
* This sample was created in the following environment: Indy, IRIX 5.3, and Uultra64 Dev. Env. 2.0h,
       and its operation was verified. 
* Settings of RSP and RDP are maintained minimum.
* The model data is made on the plane of flat shading.
* For "pack", a thread is not created for controlling graphics task, so it does not correspond to sound. It
       may be very difficult to use it continuously for a project.
* The performance of the memory manager used for "pack" will become worse if a memory block increases.  Therefore, for those who use it fully, please create it on your own or use it with a high efficiency module.
   

-- Remarks
* It is recommended that you reflect the pad input in a matrix and try various matrix modulation.
* N64 display list has a unique habit in the setting of lighting.  Please know the sense of the lighting by playing with the model data file (n64.ci) and the light structure of  3d.c,  lightset.
* The function of RDP blender is rarely used.  Please change the value to be set in gDPRenderMode() of 3d.c in many ways.
