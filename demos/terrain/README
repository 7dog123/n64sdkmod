TO RUN THIS PROGRAM TYPE:
terrain

NOTE:  RUNNING THIS PROGRAM BY TYPING GLOAD IS A BAD IDEA
BECAUSE SOME OF THE FEATURES WILL BE DISABLED.  RUIN THE 
PROGRAM BY RUNNING THE TERRAIN PROGRAM WHICH RUNS ON THE 
INDY.  THE TERRAIN PROGRAM (RUNNING ON THE INDY) WILL
GLOAD THE ROM INTO THE ULTRA64.

This is a terrain editing program.  It allows you to
interactively create a terrain on the Ultra64 using
the game controller.  The terrain that you generate 
can then ba saved back to the indy and used in a 
separate ultra64 program that you write.

GENERAL CONTROLS:
joystick:    rotate terrain
crosshair:   move cursor (and mountain)
E:           build a mountain / make a mountain higher
D:           build a ditch / make a mountain smaller
F:           make mountains wider
C:           make mounains narrower
A:           undo a mountain
B:           finalize a mountain
G:           see below
L:           turn menu on

WHILE THE TRIGGER (G) IS BEING PRESED:
joystick:   scale and move terrain up/down in view
crosshair:  move terrain in x/z in view

WHILE THE MENU IS ACTIVE:
crosshair up/down:      select different menu items
crosshair left/right:   modify values in menu
R:			choose min/max/mid value

CURSOR MODE:
When the cursor mode is MAKE MOUNTAINS the controls act
as described above.  Cursor mode of PLACE TEXTURE only
makes sense after loading a texture (see below LOADING
A TEXTURE).  When the cursor mode is PLACE TEXTURE
the controls act the same except:
A:   turn paintbrush on/off
B:   cycle through loaded textures
C-F: move a vertex laterally
R:   draw a triangle of texture (instead of a quad)

WHILE THE TRIGGER (G) IS BEING PRESED:
C-F: Alter the texture coordinates at one or more vertices.
     This is affexted by the GROUP TEXTURE and OPERATION
     modes which are in the TEXTURE MENU.

LOADING A TEXTURE:
You can load textures dynamically with the NEW TEXTURE menu 
item in the TEXTURE MENU.  When you select this menu item 
you will have to type the name of your texture at the prompt
on the indy (in the shell window where you ran the terrain 
program).  You can navigate directories by typing .. (for up
directory) or the name of a directory (for down directory).
Type the name of the texture you want.  The texture file you
specify should be a .h file created by rgb2c with the -o MIP
flag (ie a mipmapped texture).  Currently the Terrain program
only supports mipmapped textures.

BUMP FUNCTION:
You can make mountains of different shapes by selecting different
bump functions.

SIZE
The default terrain size is 32x32 quads.  You can alter the
number in the MODE MENU with the TERRAIN SIZE X and TERRAIN SIZE Z
parameters.

CONTOUR LINES
You can turn on contour lines which allow you to see the border of
each quad.  Choose ENABLE CONTOURS in the MODE MENU.


Happy terrain creating!
