# N64 SDK for Linux

Welcome! This SDK is designed to be easy to install and use for newcomers to the N64, and is supported on Debian-based Linux distros,
such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

Now supports Dockerâ„¢

It also works fine on WSL1, but does not support rsp-tools due to lack of 32bit support.

Instructions for regular installation will be in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/CrashOveride95/n64sdkmod/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

## Docker Usage

To build a Docker image from the `Dockerfile` and make it available on your machine:

1. Install Docker, e.g. `brew cask install docker` on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
2. `docker build --tag n64sdkmod-docker .`

Building the image may take a while, as a GCC cross-compiler needs to be compiled. You may also need to increase the available RAM to 4 GB in Docker's advanced settings to avoid the build process being killed for using up all available container RAM.

To run the container and compile your ROM's source code within the container:

1. `cd /path/to/your/code`
2. `docker run --volume "$(pwd):/src" n64sdkmod-docker bash -c 'cd /src && make'`

This will copy your source directory into the container, invoke the cross-compiler, and output any build artifacts to your hosts's working directory.
