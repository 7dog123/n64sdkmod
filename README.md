# N64 SDK for Linux

Welcome! This SDK is designed to be easy to install and use for newcomers to the N64, and is supported on Debian-based Linux distros,
such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

It also works fine on WSL.

Instructions for installation will be in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/CrashOveride95/n64sdkmod/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
